Offtopic is a simple web application built with link:http://ratpack.io[Ratpack]
for inspecting and consuming events from link:http://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka]

The primary goal of this tool is to give you real-time insight into a running
Kafka cluster.

== System Requirements

* Java 8
* link:http://zookeeper.apache.org[Apache Zookeeper]
* link:http://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka]

== Features

* **Watch**: From the `/topics` page clicking the "watch" button will set up a
  WebSockets-based stream of events straight from Kafka to your browser
* **Multipass**: From the `/topics` page you can select multiple topics to
  watch at once (link:http://strongspace.com/rtyler/public/offtopic-usemultipass-20141125.png[screenshot of multipass in action])
* **Binary data support**: Clicking on a message row in the "watch" view will
  drop down a base64-encoded version of the message data

== Usage Notes

As of `0.3.0` Offtopic is available as a wholly self-contained executable `.jar`
file which means running the command below will start Offtopic on link:http://localhost:5050/[localhost:5050]:

    ✗ java -jar offtopic*-all.jar
    log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (io.netty.util.internal.logging.InternalLoggerFactory).
    log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
    log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.


By default Offtopic looks for a Zookeeper on `localhost:2181`, if you wish to
connect it to another Zookeeper ensemble, use the `zookeeper` Java property,
e.g.:

    ✗ java -Dzookeepers=example.com:2181 -jar offtopic*-all.jar
    log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (io.netty.util.internal.logging.InternalLoggerFactory).
    log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
    log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.



=== Topic Watch Wildcards

A somewhat "hidden" feature is the ability to use regular expression when
watching topics. A normal topic watch URL might be
`localhost:5050/topics/foo/watch`. If there are a number of topics which are
all prefixed with `foo` you can watch them all at the same time with:
link:http://localhost:5050/topics/foo*/watch[localhost:5050/topics/foo*/watch].

The regular expressions that
link:http://www.groovy-lang.org/Regular+Expressions[Groovy supports] should all
be supported in the URL space.
